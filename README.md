> A comprehensive secret detection and management solution that unites Security Operations with Developer Operations.

Seek-Rats contains the follow components and provides in-depth defence against hardcoded secrets while maintaining development speed:

- VSCode Extension, which highlights hardcoded secrets on the development console, and provides boiler templates for secure secret management. This also cross references and excludes secrets found on the allowlist.

- Pre-commit Hook, which prevents hardcoded secrets from being committed. This also cross references and excludes secrets found on the allowlist.

- Code Review , streamlined reporting of non-cross referenced secrets on a secure site when secrets are detected in a commit or pull request. The report can be used to either add to the universal allowlist or post an exposed secret finding to AWSâ€™s Security Hub.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


 - GitHub Repository

- [python 3.8](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) 

* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

* AWS Configured CLI
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install awscli
  ```
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* AWS CDK
  ```sh
  python -m pip install aws-cdk.aws-s3 aws-cdk.aws-lambda
  ```

  
## Installation and How to Use

Our Seek-Rats solution is a multi-layered solution where users either install all components for the whole system (works the best) or install individual pieces.

To install any/all components of Seek-Rats firstly clone the repo

Linux
  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```

### **VSCode Extention Installation**
The VS Code extension adds a command to your editor that when run will scan the current file for any hard coded secrets. Hard coded secrets detected by the extension will be highlighted and when hovered over with your cursor displays any information about the secret if set.

1.  Firstly, navigate to the VSCode Extension Branch
  ```sh
   cd ./VSCode_Extension/secretscanner/
   ```
2. Install the extension through
  ```sh
   npm install
   ```

#### How to Use
Once installed in VSCode create or open a file, press 

Mac:
`cmd + Shift + p `

Windows:
`ctrl + Shift + p `

then run the command 'Scan for Secrets' in the dropdown

#### How to Configure
The 'allowlist_url' should contain your organisation's allowlist url to fetch the allowlist  
It can be extended to recognise more secret types.  
In the `src/config.json` file, add more entries to the rules array.  


'regex' is the regular expression to detect the secret type.  
'description' will be shown when the user is hovering over the secret.

### **Pre-commit Hook**
1.  Install [git-leaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) 
2.  Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
3.  Navigate to the root directory of the Seek-Rats repository

### **Secrets Code Review Report** 
The secrets code review report is hosted on AWS and interacts with GitHub Application. For these steps, please ensure you have AWS credentials set up as well as a GitHub account to create a GitHub Application.

Once the infrastructure is built, just add your GitHub application to any repository and (optional) enable checks and reviewers to be completed before a pull for best performance (This requires GitHub Teams/Pro).

As our secrets code review report backend is serverless, the following steps below outline how to install our infrastructure to your AWS services and GitHub Repository.

The following steps 
 1. Firstly, install [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) if you haven't already
2. Navigate to the terraform directory
  ```sh
   cd ./terraform/
   ```
3. Run the following commands and respond 'yes' when prompted
  ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
Once created, you should be prompted with a list of endpoints. This is needed as  we will use this to store in our GitHub Application

4. Open up [GitHub and navigate to create a new application.](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app)
 -  In your GitHub App, do the following steps:
     - For Homepage URL, you can do whatever you want as this will not be used.
	 - Put the `website_bucket_end` in the Callback URL. **After doing this place http:// at the start. This is crucial as the OAUTH redirect won't work if not done**

![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911908564916912128/unknown.png)
	 - Put the `gh_webhook_listener_endpoint` in the Webhook URL. **After doing this place / at the end. This is crucial as the webhook will not work if not done.**

	- After doing this, enable the following checks on your GitHub Application.
		- For Repository Permissions enable 
			- Contents - Read/Write
			- Issues - Read/Write
			- Metadata - Read Only
			- Pull Request - Read/Write
			- Webhooks - Read/Write
			- Commit Statuses - Read/Write
![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911910393096593458/unknown.png)	
		- For Organisation Permissions enable 
			- Members - Read Only
			- Events - Read Only
			- Webhooks - Read/Write
		- User Permissions
			- None
		- Subscribe to Events
			- Pull Request
			- Pull Request Review Comment
			- Repository

5. Once you created your GitHub Application, we now have to store our GitHub secrets in Parameter Store so we can easily access them.
		 
	For the private key, generate the key with the 'Generate a private key' button and upload the whole private key including the headers to parameter store. The key should look like the image below.

  ```sh
aws ssm put-parameter --name "gitapp_PKey" --type "SecureString" --value "YOUR GITHUP APP PERSONAL KEY"
```   

![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911916776114237470/unknown.png)
![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911917220312006657/unknown.png)
```sh
aws ssm put-parameter --name "gitapp_appID" --type "SecureString" --value "YOUR GITHUP APP ID"
```  
```sh
aws ssm put-parameter --name "gitapp_clientID" --type "SecureString" --value "YOUR GITHUP APP OAUTH CLIENT ID"
```   
![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911915946585751582/unknown.png)

```sh
aws ssm put-parameter --name "gitapp_clientSecret" --type "SecureString" --value "YOUR GITHUP APP OAUTH CLIENT SECRET"
```   
![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911915596269113354/unknown.png)

6. Navigate to the root directory of the seek rats repository and run the  create_client_id.py file

```sh
cd ../
python3 create_client_id.py
```  
7. Navigate to the Github_Bot/Webpage to build the s3 react site and sync it to the AWS S3 Bucket. 

	 seek-rats-site is the s3 bucket name in the 'website_bucket_end' variable. Screen shot of where you can find it is below.
```sh
cd ./Github_Bot/Webpage/reportfront
npm install
npm run build
aws s3 sync build s3://your-s3-bucket-name 
```  
![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911922103891132466/unknown.png)

8. Navigate back to the terraform directory and run terraform apply one more time and reply yes
```sh
cd ../../../terraform/
terraform apply
```  

9. Now the secrets backend should be running. Install your application on any repository by going ino GitHub Apps and choosing a repository 
![enter image description here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/894590864242905199/911924390256574464/unknown.png)

10. (Optional) To enforce pull requests and checks, on a repository go to branches->branch protection rules and you may add a rule.

If Seek-Rats has run atleast once your repository, you should be able to enable it in your checks (Named Secrets Review Needed)
