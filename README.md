> A comprehensive secret detection and management solution that unites Security Operations with Developer Operations.

Our solution contains the follow components, and provides in-depth defence against hardcoded secrets while maintaining development speed:

- VSCode Extension, which highlights hardcoded secrets on the development console, and provides boiler templates for secure secret management. This also cross references and excludes secrets found on the allowlist.
- Pre-commit Hook, which prevents hardcoded secrets from being committed. This also cross references and excludes secrets found on the allowlist.
- Code Review , streamlined reporting of non-cross referenced secrets on a secure site when secrets are detected in a commit or pull request. The report can be used to either add to the universal allowlist or post an exposed secret finding to AWSâ€™s Security Hub.
